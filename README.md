## Web Page Designs
The two designs that you need to "maquetear" are
- [Home Page](mockups/home-page.png)
- [Property Page](mockups/property-page.png)

In both pages there are carousels and we recommend you use the [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) which is already installed in the vendor directory.

### Home Page
The home page consists of the following:
1. Contact header with a search input
2. A Menu
3. A hero image with your 2 main select filters with the following options:
    - Property operations: Sale, Rent and Vacation Rentals
    - Property Types: Apartment, Building, House, Land and Office
4. A 3x3 grid of featured properties
5. An agent carousel with navigation arrows: [GIF](http://g.recordit.co/9B9bzxw1HZ.gif)
6. Contact footer

### Property Page
The property page consists of the following:
1. Contact header with a search input
2. A Menu
3. Title and address section
4. Property images carousel with navigation arrows: [GIF](http://g.recordit.co/Ydct37Ak4g.gif)
5. Property details section with a contact form
6. Property description and amenities section
7. A responsive map
8. A 3x1 grid of similar properties
9. Contact footer

## Style Requirements
Make sure you code meets all the [style guide](style-guide.md) requirements.

## Deliverables
You should deliver the project sharing a link to your fork. Keep in mind that the code you deliver should be considered high quality and ready to be used in a production environment and reviewed by your peers.
